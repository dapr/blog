## What is OpenFunction

[OpenFunction](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction) is an open-source, cloud-agnostic FaaS platform, accepted as a CNCF sandbox project on April 26, 2022. With OpenFunction, you can focus on your business logic without maintaining the underlying runtime environment. The OpenFunction community believes that functions should be able to run on any infrastructures or clouds.

## Why a FaaS platform like OpenFunction needs Dapr

Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless, and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge. Dapr helps developers tackle the challenges of building microservices and keeps the code platform-agnostic by embracing the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.

Nowadays, applications are mostly distributed applications. Dapr:

1. Abstracts the common functionalities of distributed applications into various building blocks, such as bindings, pub/sub, and state management.
2. Exposes these functionalities with unified HTTP or gRPC APIs.

Functions are also distributed applications with similar requirements, like input/output, pub/sub events, and get/set states. Unlike distributed applications, functions focus less concern on the underlying platforms or services, and more on business logic - exactly what Dapr tries to solve.

In the _A Berkeley View on Serverless Computing_ paper, "Serverless" is defined as `Serverless = FaaS + BaaS`.

<div align=center><img width="80%" height="80%" src=serverless.png /></div>

Usually a FaaS platform supports several languages and it needs to communicate with various backend services such as object storage, database, message queue etc. Let's suppose a FaaS platform supports 5 languages and needs to communicate with 10 message queues. 

- Without Dapr, each language will have to communicate with each message queue using this MQ's own SDK which requires 5x10=50 implementations.
- With Dapr, each language only needs to communicate with Dapr using Dapr SDK and Dapr will handle the rest communication with different message queues which only requires 5x1=5 implementations.

As you can see from the above analysis, the complexity of a FaaS platfrom has been significantly reduced by introducing Dapr.

Dapr is actually another layer between FaaS and BaaS:

It acts as a unified interface for FaaS to various backend services:

## Using Dapr in OpenFunction

OpenFunction is designed with several principles in mind that is open，flexible，and pluggable. This is where Dapr can help:

- By introducing Dapr, both sync and async function runtimes are able to utilize the power of distributed application runtime including input/output binding, pubsub, and state management etc. Different types of functions are able to communicate with various middleware, data sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Kafka, NATS Streaming, MQTT and cloud providers' MQ in a unified, low cost and pluggable way.
- The EventBus of OpenFunction Events is built with Dapr's pubsub building block, which enables users to use the message queue of their choice as the EventBus's backend.

### The Sync and Async function runtimes

OpenFunction supports two runtimes currently, the Knative Sync runtime and the OpenFunction Async runtime. Previously only OpenFunction Async runtime uses Dapr, and we added Dapr support to Knative Sync runtime as well in [v0.6.0](https://openfunction.dev/blog/2022/03/25/announcing-openfunction-0.6.0-faas-observability-http-trigger-and-more/).

#### OpenFunction Async runtime

- Uses KEDA to trigger and autoscale async functions.
- Fetch input event from various Dapr input binding or pubsub components.
- Send functions output to Dapr output binding or pubsub components.

Here you can find a [elastic log alerting](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/logs-handler-function) async function sample:

- Kubernetes logs are collected and forwarded to Kafka
- An async function is deployed to find `404` errors in log messages of wordpress pods in a specified namespace
- An alert will be sent to [Notification Manager](https://github.com/kubesphere/notification-manager) whenever the async function find a `404` error 
- [Notification Manager](https://github.com/kubesphere/notification-manager) will then send a notification to Slack

<div align=center><img src=elastic-log-processing.svg /></div>

The async function is defined below, with familiar Dapr component definitions:

```yaml=
apiVersion: core.openfunction.io/v1beta1

            value: http://notification-manager-svc.kubesphere-monitoring-system.svc.cluster.local:19093/api/v2/alerts
```

#### Knative Sync runtime

- Sync functions is triggered by HTTP request, so Dapr is not used in sync function input.
- Whenever there are functions output requirements, sync functions can also send output to Dapr output binding or pubsub components.

Here is another function sample:

- Users send a HTTP request to a [Knative Sync function](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/knative/with-output-binding).
- This sync function handles the request and then send its output to Kafka through a Dapr Kafka output binding or pubsub component.
- An [async function](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/bindings/kafka-input) is then triggered by this output event in Kafka (through a Dapr Kafka input binding or pubsub component)

<div align=center><img src=knative-dapr.svg /></div>

This Knative Sync function is defined as below:

```yaml=
apiVersion: core.openfunction.io/v1beta1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: function-front
spec:
  version: "v1.0.0"
  image: "openfunctiondev/sample-knative-dapr:latest"
  imageCredentials:
    name: push-secret
  port: 8080 # default to 8080
  build:
    builder: openfunction/builder-go:latest
    env:
      FUNC_NAME: "ForwardToKafka"
      FUNC_CLEAR_SOURCE: "true"
    srcRepo:
      url: "https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples.git"
      sourceSubPath: "functions/knative/with-output-binding"
      revision: "main"
  serving:
    scaleOptions:
      minReplicas: 0
      maxReplicas: 5
    runtime: knative
    outputs:
      - name: target
        component: kafka-server
        operation: "create"
    bindings:
      kafka-server:
        type: bindings.kafka
        version: v1
        metadata:
          - name: brokers
            value: "kafka-server-kafka-brokers:9092"
          - name: authRequired
            value: "false"
          - name: publishTopic
            value: "sample-topic"
          - name: topics
            value: "sample-topic"
          - name: consumerGroup
            value: "function-front"
    template:
      containers:
        - name: function
          imagePullPolicy: Always
```

### The Functions Framework

You don't need to write any Dapr-specific code in sync or async functions to communicate with Dapr. You simply call the `ctx.send` method from the Functions Framework to send function output. Functions Framework will call the Dapr SDK to communicate with various Dapr input/output binding or pub/sub components.

**Note**: `ctx.output` for output binding and `ctx.publish` for pub/sub may be added in the future.

Currently, Dapr support has been added to [Go functions framework](https://github.com/OpenFunction/functions-framework-go) and [Nodejs functions framework](https://github.com/OpenFunction/functions-framework-nodejs).  Dapr support to Python/Java/dotNet functions frameworks is still underway.

### OpenFunction Events

Event-driven is one of the core features of a FaaS platform. Inspired by Argo Events, OpenFunction created its own OpenFunction Events. Unlike Argo Events, OpenFunction Events' EventBus is decoupled with the underlying message queue implementation using Dapr pub/sub. This means you can use any message queue you prefer as EventBus, including Kafka, NATS Streaming, Pulsar, GCP pub/sub, Azure Event Hubs, etc.

### Future

Although functions are usually considered to be stateless, state management is still important to a FaaS platform. OpenFunction will support the Dapr state management building block to enable functions to get/set states more conveniently. In addition, the recent workflow building block proposal might be used to implement the Serverless workflow spec.

Furthermore, if you would like to know how OpenFunction uses Dapr to build a FaaS platform for [UISEE](https://www.uisee.com/en/)(an autonomous driving company) to handle their vehicle data, don't miss our talk [Empower Autonomous Driving with Cloud Native Serverless Technologies](https://kccnceu2022.sched.com/event/ytmN/empower-autonomous-driving-with-cloud-native-serverless-technologies-benjamin-huo-qingcloud-technologies-xiuming-lu-uisee) in KubeCon EU 2022.
