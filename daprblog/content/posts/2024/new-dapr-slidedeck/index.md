A new [Dapr slide deck](https://docs.dapr.io/contributing/presentations/) is available that you can use for your Dapr presentations!

![Slide deck overview](slide-overview.png)

The deck contains new icons for all the Dapr APIs and built-in features, such as security, resiliency, and observability. The presentation style matches the recently redesigned [dapr.io](http://dapr.io) website.
The slide deck consists of over 140 slides that can be used as a starting point for your presentation. Remove or hide what is not necessary for your audience, and add new slides to add relevance to your story.

Here are some slides from the deck:

![From Development to Hosting](slide17.png "From Development to Hosting")

![Components](slide18.png "Components")

![Using the Dapr APIs](slide20.png "Using the Dapr APIs")

![Workflow example](slide52.png "Workflow example")

Follow the instructions on the first 3 slides to get started on building new slides and diagrams. The last 20 slides in the deck contain visual assets you can use.

Like the [Dapr diagram slide deck](https://docs.dapr.io/contributing/docs-contrib/contributing-docs/#diagrams-and-images), the [Dapr presentation slide deck](https://docs.dapr.io/contributing/presentations/) (PowerPoint format) is open source, so contributions are welcome!
