A few days ago we've [announced](https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2020/10/01/dapr-v0.11.0-is-now-available/) the availability of Dapr v0.11.0.

Shortly after the release, two critical issues were detected which have prompted us to release two hotfixes to address them. Please see more details in the release notes for [hotfix v0.11.1](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v0.11.1) and [hotfix 0.11.2](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v0.11.2).

The two issues addressed are:

* Remote actor invocation timeout error on Kubernetes with mTLS enabled ([Issue #2195](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2195))
* Dapr sidecar authentication issue when high availability mode is enabled ([Issue #2195](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2187))

Making sure we provide the community with high quality release is a top priority for us and so we aim to respond quickly to high priority issues that arise. As we move forward, we'll be adding more testing to cover areas in Dapr that are currently not thoroughly tested.

We invite the community to continue and contribute to Dapr through new issues that are encountered and code contributions that help make Dapr more resilient.
