Ever since the initial release of Dapr a year ago, we have seen a tremendous amount of participation from the community. The increasing real-world usage and direct feedback have been critical to continuous improvement of Dapr. Over the 11 releases during the first year, Dapr has evolved to the point where now multiple companies are realizing its value in production environments. Based on this validation, and in recognition of the functionality that our users already rely on in production use-cases, we are setting Dapr today on the path to official v1.0 release.

Our goal is to have the first v1.0 release candidate (RC) available in Nov 2020, and then release subsequent candidates (e.g. v1.0.0-rc1, v1.0.0-rc2, etc.) as we get feedback and guarantee the stability of our APIs, features, and components. The Dapr v1.0 release will cover Dapr Core, CLI, and Dashboard, as well as the SDKs for .NET, Go, Java, Node.js, and Python. In addition, about 15 of the 75+ Dapr components will be certified as “stable”. We will provide guidance on the process to promote additional components. Finally, while Dapr itself is hosting platform agnostic, the v1.0 release will be validated for production use only on Kubernetes and in self-hosted model on VMs.

This is a significant milestone for the Dapr project. Are you interested in helping with the v1.0 release? Tell us about your experience in building and operating Dapr applications. We are interested in any issues, friction, or inconsistencies you may encounter and any ways we can improve on that experience. This is also a great time to provide feedback on our documentation.

We are excited that after only one year we are able to outline this path to v1.0 Dapr release. A release that delivers on the features requested by developers and operators and provides the Dapr community with the necessary confidence for use in production deployments. We appreciate your help and your ongoing contributions on this amazing journey together.
